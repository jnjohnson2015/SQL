This is the creation of the Grocery Inventory List where I'm creating columns, rows, and the primary key for the database. 


create table inventory (id integer primary key, name text, price integer,quantity integer, aisle integer, rating integer);
insert into inventory values(1,"oreos",5.99,37,3,5);
insert into inventory values(2,"chips ahoy",3.99,52,3,5);
insert into inventory values(3,"Fruit by the Foot",2.99,39,4,9);
insert into inventory values(4,"Lays Original", 2.49,70,8,7);
insert into inventory values(5,"Jiffy Cornbread", 1.48,40,7,7);
insert into inventory values(6,"Betty Crocker Confetti Cake Mix",3.49,89,7,7);
insert into inventory values(7,"Frosted Flakes", 4.78,102,7,8);
insert into inventory values(8,"Fruity Pebbles", 4.86,98,7,7);
insert into inventory values(9,"Domino Pure Cane Sugar", 2.46,98,3,10);
insert into inventory values(10,"Party Pizza Combination",1.53,76,2,3);
insert into inventory values(11,"Pizza Rolls",6.45,56,2,5);
insert into inventory values(12,"Rainbow Popcicles",3.56,100,2,8);
insert into inventory values(13,"Crinkle Cut Fries",4.49,65,2,8);
insert into inventory values(14,"Orange Juice",3.39,78,9,9);
insert into inventory values(15,"Fudge Bars",3.29,64,2,10);

This statement selects all products from the database and sorts them by the aisle number.
select * from inventory order by aisle;

This statement gives the sum of all products within the database.
select sum(price) from inventory;

This statement allows us to inventory what is on each aisle.
select name,quantity,aisle from inventory order by aisle desc;
